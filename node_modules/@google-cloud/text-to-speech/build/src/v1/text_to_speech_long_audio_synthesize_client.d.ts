     * in [this document](https://github.com/googleapis/gax-nodejs/blob/main/client-libraries.md#creating-the-client-instance).
     * The common options are:
     * @param {object} [options.credentials] - Credentials object.
     * @param {string} [options.credentials.client_email]
     * @param {string} [options.credentials.private_key]
     * @param {string} [options.email] - Account email address. Required when

     * @param {string} [options.keyFilename] - Full path to the a .json, .pem, or
     *     .p12 key downloaded from the Google Developers Console. If you provide
     *     a path to a JSON file, the projectId option below is not necessary.

     * @param {number} [options.port] - The port on which to connect to
     *     the remote host.
     * @param {string} [options.projectId] - The project ID from the Google
     *     Developer's Console, e.g. 'grape-spaceship-123'. We will also check
     *     the environment variable GCLOUD_PROJECT for your project ID. If your

     *     API remote host.
     * @param {gax.ClientConfig} [options.clientConfig] - Client configuration override.

     *     For more information, please check the
